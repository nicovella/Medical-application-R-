# Medical-application-R-
the basic data exploration and data impotatin in medical field, working with R.
This repository does NOT contain the CVS file because it is not possible to share the personal patients files. 
This repository only contain the code to data exploretion:Inspect baseline distributions (age, sex, diagnosis, comorbidities), Explore longitudinal trends in MMDs and headache severity, Quantify dropouts and treatment discontinuations.
And data imputation: 
Explore missingness patterns and data characteristics (e.g., monotonicity) in
baseline variables (e.g., demographics, disease history) and longitudinal
variables (e.g., repeated measurements by cycle and month).
Compare and select appropriate imputation strategies for baseline variables,
including mean/median imputation, regression imputation, and most frequent
category imputation for categorical variables.
Compare and select appropriate model-based imputation strategies for
baseline variables, particularly multivariate imputation methods (e.g., MICE).
Based on the research questions, compare imputation methods while also
considering the requirements and assumptions of the specific analytical
model.
Assess imputation strategies for longitudinal variables by comparing different
methods, including Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), Next
Observation Carried Backward (NOCB), and linear interpolation.
